# LHTL: Learning How To Learn

This project intends to be an assignment for the ["Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects"](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning) course available on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org).

As the assignment says:

> The goal of Assignment #2 is to educate others in a significant and meaningful way about at least 3 of the topics covered in this course. In accomplishing this goal, you will affirm your own understanding of effective learning techniques and how they relate to your life and goals. Your project could take the form of teaching others in person (or via videotape), creating new pedagogical content, journaling your own learning in a way that is educational to others, blogging, etc.

These are the key topics covered on the course:
* Focused and diffuse modes of thinking.
* Key techniques proven by research to help students learn most efficiently
* Illusions of learning
* Memory
* Chunking
* Sleep
* Metaphor, story, and visualization in learning
* Transfer of ideas and concepts from one area to another
* Deliberate practice
* Interleaving
* Procrastination
* Testing
* Mindset
* Working with others in learning
* Cultural similarities and differences in learning
* Life-long learning and broadening your passions
* Learning independently

I'd like to write about all of them. Unfortunatelly I don't have much time, so I'm still deciding which topics I'm going to cover.
